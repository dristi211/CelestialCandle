oh no why showing this build error message!! click the option OK to run the app with the last build and no update was showing.....then from the Error list saw the File name and line where the error was found and it is an extra curly braces } :)

In the HelloWorldController.cs lets try to change the name of the action method ---public IActionResult Index()method name to Radiance() and check if it works
